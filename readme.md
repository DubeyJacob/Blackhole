# Blackhole

### Introduction

This is our (Raniel, Jacob, Apollo) game for the game jam. It is a dodging game where you accumulate score as time progresses.

### Mechanics

There is a player controlled block that you can move along the x axis. However, it will always stay at y = 600. The purpose is to dodge incoming blocks which vary in speed. There will only be 7 blocks (discounting the player) on the screen at the same time and they have no acceleration, meaning that whatever they velocity they start with they will maintain throughout the entire course of the game. If the player collides with one of the 7 blocks the game will end and their final score will be displayed. The player will then have the option to press Enter to restart the game or press Esc to exit out of the program.
